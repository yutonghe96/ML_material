This repository contains projects developed using machine learning techniques and real-world datasets. Each project is complete with a Jupyter Notebook documenting the model development, and either written reports or presentation slides.

In airbnb_clustering: unsupervised models are developed to identify clusters of airbnb listings in Stockholm, Sweden.
Key words: principal component analysis (PCA), K-means, mean-shift, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (TSNE).

In capstone: analytical methods and machine learning (both supervised and unsupervised) models are used for personalized recommender system.
Key words: exploratory data analysis, content-based recommender, collaborative-filtering based recommender, k-nearest neighbour (kNN), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), neural network embedding.

In energy_forecast: deep learning models are developed to forecast the time series of energy consumption in Tetouan, Morocco, over different time scales. 
Key words: long short-term memory (LSTM) models, recurrent neural network (RNN).

In movie_classifier: supervised models are developed to classify movies into binary categories of winning awards and not winning awards. 
Key words: logistic regression (l1, l2, elastic-net), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, random forest.
